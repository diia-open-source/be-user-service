# Contributing to the Diia project

We're pleased that you're interested in contributing to the Diia project. At the moment we're welcoming contributions in various forms and we want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible. You're welcome to contribute in any of the following ways:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Proposing new features or ideas

In the future we'll be considering welcoming code contributions and expanding our contributor community.

## Report using Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug, feature, idea or open a discussion point by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new); it's that easy!

For bugs related to vulnerabilities or security concerns please feel free to contact us directly at [modt.opensource@thedigital.gov.ua](mailto:modt.opensource@thedigital.gov.ua).

We'd also request that you detail bug reports with detail, background and sample code. Typically a great bug report includes:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific and provide sample code if you can.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

For ideas, suggestions and discussion you're free to use any format that you find suitable.
