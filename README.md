# Diia

This repository provides an overview over the flagship product [**Diia**](https://diia.gov.ua/) developed by the [**Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine**](https://thedigital.gov.ua/).

**Diia** is an app with access to citizenâ€™s digital documents and government services.

The application was created so that Ukrainians could interact with the state in a few clicks, without spending their time on queues and paperwork - **Diia** open source application will help countries, companies and communities build a foundation for long-term relationships. At the heart of these relations are openness, efficiency and humanity.

We're pleased to share the **Diia** project with you.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the service which provides capabilities for user settings management.

## Build Process

### **1. Clone codebase via `git clone` command**

Example:

```
git clone https://github.com/diia-open-source/be-user-service.git user-service
```

---

### **2. Go to code base root directory**

```
cd ./user-service
```

---

### **3. Install npm dependencies**

The installation of dependencies consists of the following 2 steps:

#### **1. Manually clone, build and link dependencies from `@diia-inhouse` scope**

Each Diia service depends on dependencies from `@diia-inhouse/<package>` scope which are distributed across different repositories, are built separately, and aren't published into public npm registry.

The full list of such dependencies can be found in the target service `package.json` file in `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections respectively.

Detailed instructions on how to link dependencies from `@diia-inhouse/<package>` scope can be found in [LINKDEPS.md](https://github.com/diia-open-source/diia-setup-howto/tree/main/backend/LINKDEPS.md)

#### **2. Install public npm dependencies and use those linked from `@diia-inhouse` scope**

In order to install and use the linked dependencies for `user-service` the following command can be used:

```
$ cd ./user-service
$ npm link @diia-inhouse/db @diia-inhouse/redis ... @diia-inhouse/<package-name>
```

In case all dependencies from `@diia-inhouse` scope are linked, and can be resolved, you will then have a complete list of dependencies installed for the service code base.

---

### **4. Build service**

In order to build the service you have to run the command `npm run build` inside the root directory of service code base as per:

```
$ cd ./user-service
$ npm run build
```

---

### **5. Run the service locally**

In order to run the service locally you need to setup a Docker ecosystem (which runs required services such as Redis, MongoDB etc.), then create a suitable environment file `.env`, run database migrations (if required) and finally run the service itself in desired mode.

The following walks through these stages step by step...

#### **1. Run docker ecosystem**

See how to [run ecosystem](https://github.com/diia-open-source/diia-setup-howto/tree/main/backend/README.md).

#### **2. Create .env file**

In order to create a proper `.env` file to populate the node process environment you can copy it from `.env.example` such as:

```
$ cd ./user-service
$ cp .env.example .env
```

#### **3. Run database migrations**

In some services there is requirement to create MongoDB schemas before running these in order to make them functional. If the service has `migrate` script inside `package.json` then it definitely must be executed.

```
$ npm run migrate up
```

#### **4. Run the service**

Main execution file is located `./dist/index.js`

```
$ node ./dist/index.js
```
